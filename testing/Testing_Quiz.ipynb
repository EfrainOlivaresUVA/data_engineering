So the Given-When-Then paradigm means providing the Context or use case that is running (Given), the condition under test, or the action being taken (When), and finally what result or end condition is to be met (Then)."

    "##### The correct answer is c.  Randomless is really about the inablity to predict the 'next' value given the previous values.  Computers on the other hand, function because of exactly the opposite reason, a set of conditions (state of registers) has a predictable next step, otherwise they just wouldn't work.  "

Whether you refactor in the tight loop of code-test-refactor, or you do a large refactor near the end, or decide to refactor someone else's code in order to understand and own it, it is the breath and coverage of the tests that guarantee the code keeps working as expected.  That's what gives you the security and freedom to improve the code."

Note that we didn't specify how complete the tests could be, so the reason why this seems the best answer to me is becuase of the active attempt to add new tests and refactor any unclear code.  If you make it a habit to code-test-refactor, this is the best way to become familiar with new code.  "

That sounds a llittle extreme, and I don't test everything, but when I do think of a test, usually the only reason I leave it out is because it may run too long ( so I put it in a diferent stack of tests), or I realize that there is really no value or goes contrary to what the code should do.

BDD also emphasises clear examples that can be read by and understood by all roles, so it leans towards human readable yet executable descriptions, of which Gherkin is a ubuquitous example.  Despite all that, using Gherkin syntax is useful even at the TDD level, and both methodologies are NOT mutually exclusive.\n"

When you consider that input to your program may come from an API, or be run in large batch files with tons of data, the simple things, like `0`, really large numbers, or passing in the letter `d` when you expected a number can lead to unfortunate consequences.  If this happens in production, it means a lot of work just in overhead to track the issue."

What we mean in this course about data testing, is testing, (or we can call it validating), certain aspects of real production data.  Some concepts are useful to borrow from software testing, like testing for invariants, and taking the description of the data as the requirements, and finally, automation is key since typically the data is large, or we want to cotiniously test it as it feeds through the system."
