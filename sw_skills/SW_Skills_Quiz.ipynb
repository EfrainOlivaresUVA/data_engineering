It does not need to be expressed as OOP, in fact it can even be applied in non object oriented languages.  They originally came from the field of Architecture, (The Timeless way of Building, Christofer Alexander), as it applied to reusable patterns of building structures given how the structure would be used.  This is what gives a library a different feel than a church, or a stadium from a movie theater."

This helps reduce overhead starting and stopping connections for example."
