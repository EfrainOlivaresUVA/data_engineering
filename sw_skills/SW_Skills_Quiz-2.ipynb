For example, assembling an algorithm but stubbing out all external dependencies like a database, or the reverse, using pre-determined output to test real connections or hardware.  "

This leads to having solutions in search for a problem rather than the other way around and results in code bloat or over complex code.  "

    "##### The correct answer is d)  This is a good example of why it's good to consider the entire context and it's forces.  If say for example you only need to stub out a couple of calls, and there is no timing dependency or other behavioral aspects, then the Factory approach is a simple way to replace the RealDB with a simple stub.  However, if your code needs to replicate delays in the timing of the calls, or other real-life effects, then a Proxy would be a better approach since you can add a layer between your calling code and the stubbed out DB.   The Strategy pattern in effect, may be functional, but it puts the test object on an equal footing as the real DB.  It might be applicable if you intended to use many types of DBs and that might justify exposing the inteface to the type of db as an object passed in, but in the simple case of a stub it is overcomplex and out of place."

    "\n",
    "##### The correct answer is a)  Encapsulation is really more about hiding implementation details.  In both cases, SRP and ISP, may hide details, but they really are more about avoiding side effects and keeping your code untangled."
