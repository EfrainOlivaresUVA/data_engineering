    "## In this Lab you will create a module that has 3 layers, combining 3 different behaviours into one file.\n",
    "### The purpose of the lab is to incoporate testing as part of the process of development.  In smaller single file scripts it is often easier to just include tests inline.  The tests can co-exist with the code with out interfering, and we can run the script as a standalone for manual testing too.\n",

    "We'll use a singleton class connecting to a fake database.  The purpose of the 3 layered architecture in combination with the singleton is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple imports of the file will not trigger a re-connection to the database\n",
    "2. Running `pytest <module-name>` will result in only the tests triggering to verify the function(s) inside it\n",
    "3. Running `python <module-name>` will give you an open connection to the database\n"

So we'll add a couple of helper functions to simulate an initialized db, and also to clear and reset so we can test."
